## What is SilverStripe?

SilverStripe is a content management system built on top of a PHP programming framework. It is used to build websites, intranets and web applications.

Besides a powerful and intuitive content authoring application, SilverStripe contains a powerful PHP5-based programming framework. The SilverStripe Framework brings immense flexibility and ease in customising your site and provides fundamentals such as security models, workflow, caching, and multiple language and subsite support.

SilverStripe CMS is open source, underpinned by public documentation, free code, and a developer community. It is based on open standards and supports multiple technology platforms. 

## Requirements

SilverStripe needs to be installed on a web server. Content authors and website administrators use their web browser to access a web-based GUI to do their day-to-day work. Website designers and developers require access to the files on the server to update templates, website logic, and perform upgrades or maintainance.
